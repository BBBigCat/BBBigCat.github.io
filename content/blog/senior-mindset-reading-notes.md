最近读完了《Senior Mindset》高级心态这本书，记录一些不错的观点

## What makes you a senior software engineer anyway?

`你到底凭什么成为高级软件工程师？`

1. A senior engineer does so much more than just write code and design systems

    `高级工程师的工作远不止编写代码和设计系统`

### So how do you become a senior engineer?

`那么，如何成为一名高级工程师呢？`

1. Own the process. The whole process. Be the project manager you want to see in the world

    `掌控过程。整个过程。成为你希望在世界上看到的项目经理`

## Why engineers are worth so much

`工程师为何价值连城`

1. That's because you've created an asset.

    `这是因为你创造了一项资产`
2. An asset that's going to keep doing your job long after you've moved on. After you've left the company even. Your code's gonna keep chugging along making cash

    `在你离开公司很久之后，你的工作仍将继续。甚至在你离开公司之后。你的代码会继续运转，赚取现金。`
3. That's why engineers are worth

    `这就是工程师的价值所在`

## Why you should talk about engineering salaries

`为什么要讨论工程人员的薪酬`

### Consider your value

`考虑你的价值`

1. The mindset shift I urge you to consider is this: It doesn't matter how hard or how much you work, it only matters how much value they get

    `我敦促你们考虑的心态转变是这样的：你工作得多努力、多辛苦并不重要，重要的是他们能得到多少价值`
2. I think that's why engineers are squeamish about salary. We think we're overpaid. Wet think our work's too easy.

    `我想，这就是工程师们对薪水心存芥蒂的原因。“我们认为我们的报酬过高。我们认为我们的工作太简单`

3. But You deliver tons of value. Tons

    `但你提供了大量的价值`

## Building software is a distraction

`构建软件让人分心`

### People buy your solution, not your software

`人们购买的事你的解决方案，而不是你的软件`

1. Build the service first. Solve somebody’s problem. Make them a better human. Get paid.

    `首先建立服务。解决别人的问题。让他们成为更好的人。获得报酬`

## My favorite lessons from Pragmatic Programmer

`我最喜欢的《实用程序员课》`

1. Duplicate your code, not your intent

    `复制你的代码，而不是你的意图`

2. Do what works, not what's fashionable

    `做有效的事，而不是时髦的事`

## What I learned from Software Engineering at Google

`我从谷歌软件工程学到了什么`

### Software Engineering vs. Programming

`软件工程与编程`

1. Software engineering is programming over time

    `软件工程是长期编程`

2. That’s engineering: considering the long-term effects of your code. Both direct and indirect.

    `这就是工程：要考虑代码的长期影响。既要考虑直接影响，也要考虑间接影响`

## How to succeed as a lead engineer – tactics and mindsets from practice

`如何成功担任首席工程师--来自实践的策略和思维方式`

### How to succeed as a lead engineer

`如何成功担任首席工程师`

1. You often have no power – you don’t choose your team, you don’t hire anyone, you don’t pick what to work on … you manage the project, not the people

    `你往往没有权力--你不能选择你的团队，你不能雇用任何人，你不能选择工作内容......你管理的是项目，而不是人`
2. Because you’re lead engineer your main work is still writing the code. You are expected to focus on implementing the feature, making tests pass, getting through code review

    `因为你是首席工程师，所以你的主要工作仍然是编写代码。你需要专注于功能的实现，使测试通过，通过代码审查`
3. Managing the project is just tacked on top. It won’t show up in your sprint, time will not be allotted. You just gotta find it.

    `管理项目只是附加的工作。它不会出现在你的冲刺阶段，也不会分配时间。你只需找到它`

4. Your objective is a successful project

    `你的目标是项目取得成功`

5. Your role is that of a force multiplier

    `你的作用是增强战斗力`

6. Your job is to take on the crap work nobody else wants to do

    `你的工作就是承担别人不愿意做的垃圾工作`
